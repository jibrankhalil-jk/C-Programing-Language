To run c files you must have a c compiler installed in your computer

Most used c compiler is gcc ( GNU Compiler Collection )

got to  https://gcc.gnu.org/ to download the compiler

after installing the compiler follow thes steps to compile the a c program

1 (without changing the output name )
      gcc [c file name with .c extension ]
      e.g  gcc mycprogram.c
    this will compile the mycprogram.c and will generate an output file with a.exe 
    a.exe is an executable file which can be run directly clicking on the file or 
    type this comman
    ./a.exe

2 (changing the output file name)
      gcc [c file name with .c extension ] -o [output file name]
      e.g  gcc mycprogram.c -o program
    this will compile the mycprogram.c and will generate an output file with the name you provided
    like program
    program.exe is an executable file which can be run directly clicking on the file or 
    type this 
    ./program.exe


summary 
     you have to first compile the c program and then run the executable file 
        example 1
            gcc mycprogram.c 
            ./a.exe 
         example 2
            gcc mycprogram.c -o program
            ./program.exe


 ** Trick
    comple and run in a single command like this
    example 1
      gcc cprogram.c ; ./a 
    example 1
     gcc cprogram.c -o program ; ./program
